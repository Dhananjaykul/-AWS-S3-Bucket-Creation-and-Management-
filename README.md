# üìù AWS S3 Bucket Creation and Management üì¶

## Introduction

Welcome to the AWS S3 Bucket Creation and Management repository! This project is part of the #90DaysOfDevOps challenge, and it focuses on creating and managing S3 buckets in AWS using Terraform.

## Overview

Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service) is a highly scalable, secure, and reliable object storage service provided by AWS. It offers various features, including data availability, performance, and security. In this project, we will explore how to create and manage S3 buckets using Terraform.

## Prerequisites

Before getting started, ensure that you have the following prerequisites:

- Terraform: Install Terraform on your system. You can download it from the official website.
- AWS Account: Create an AWS account if you don't have one. You can sign up for the AWS Free Tier.
- Configuration Files: Create the necessary configuration files for Terraform.

## Repository Structure

- `S3.tf`: Contains the Terraform code for creating an S3 bucket.
- `public_access.tf`: Includes the Terraform code for configuring public read access.
- `IAM.tf`: Contains the Terraform code for creating an S3 bucket policy.
- `README.md`: You are here!

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/Dhananjaykul/-AWS-S3-Bucket-Creation-and-Management-.git
   ```

2. Set up the required configuration files for Terraform.

3. Initialize the Terraform configuration:

   ```
   terraform init
   ```

4. Review the changes that will be applied:

   ```
   terraform plan
   ```

5. Apply the Terraform configuration to create the S3 bucket:

   ```
   terraform apply
   ```

6. Follow the instructions provided in the blog post for additional configuration steps.

## Conclusion

By following this project, you will gain hands-on experience in creating and managing S3 buckets using Terraform. Explore the vast possibilities of Amazon S3 and enhance your skills in AWS cloud computing.
